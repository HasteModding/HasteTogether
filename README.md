# HasteTogether
*A work-in-progress multiplayer mod for Haste: Broken Worlds*

This is both an attempt at multiplayer, and a learning experience for me to learn more C#, so code may be unoptimized, or completely generated for me to step through and work upon.<br>
It's still very much in beta, so the code is horrible, but pull requests / issues are appreciated :)
